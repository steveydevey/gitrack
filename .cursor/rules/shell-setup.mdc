# Shell Environment Setup

## Issue: Bundle Command Not Found

When running commands in the Cursor AI environment, `bundle` may not be found because the shell doesn't automatically source `~/.bashrc` where the gem bin directory is added to PATH.

## Solution

The gem bin directory is: `/home/steve/.local/share/gem/ruby/3.4.0/bin`

### Option 1: Export PATH in Commands

When running bundle commands, prefix with PATH export:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/home/steve/.local/share/gem/ruby/3.4.0/bin && bundle exec rspec
```

### Option 2: Use Full Path

Use the full path to bundle:

```bash
/home/steve/.local/share/gem/ruby/3.4.0/bin/bundle exec rspec
```

### Option 3: Source bashrc

Run commands in a bash shell that sources bashrc:

```bash
bash -c "source ~/.bashrc && bundle exec rspec"
```

## Recommended Approach

For Cursor AI tool calls, use Option 1 (export PATH) as it's the most reliable and doesn't require full paths or shell spawning.

## Ruby Version

Current Ruby version: 3.4.7  
Gem directory: `/home/steve/.local/share/gem/ruby/3.4.0`

Note: Even though Ruby is 3.4.7, gems are installed in the 3.4.0 directory structure.
